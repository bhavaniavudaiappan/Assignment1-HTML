        This is my first webpage. This webpage is build using HTML. This basic webpage consists of a html tag, 
        head tag, title tag and body tag. A simple webpage is very easy to build. HTML code can be written in any
        text editor. The text editor which I have used is VS Code, which is a very useful text editor for beginners
        as well as pros. It is also very user friendly.
